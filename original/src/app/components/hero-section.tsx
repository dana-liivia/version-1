                <p>I’m Dana and I started my journey in economics as a commercial clerk, where I learned the ropes of
                    organizational and business management. <br/>But curiosity got the better of me, and I found my way
                    into the world of technology—first as a software developer and now as a Scrum Master (or Team Coach,
                    if you prefer). Helping teams work better together and watching them thrive is what keeps me
                    motivated every day.

                    <br/><br/>On top of that, I’m tackling a part-time bachelor’s degree in Digital Business and AI,
                    because who doesn’t love a challenge? Juggling work, studies, and a constant drive to learn
                    definitely keeps life exciting (though coffee deserves some credit, too).<br/><br/>

                    When I’m not knee-deep in projects or assignments, you’ll probably find me hanging out with my dog,
                    who has a knack for making life a little brighter—and my floors a little messier.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Feel free to explore my portfolio! Whether you want to collaborate, chat, or just swap dog stories,
                    I’d love to hear from you.
                </p>
